Specifications:
  -I have not tested with any GPU other than my native Nvidia GPU, so it may or may not work for you.
  -You may have to change some settings to get it to work with displays that are not QHD with standard aspect ratio.
  
If you plan on editing the code with VSCode make sure to rename the "vscode" file to ".vscode".
